### Description

The included Excel spreadsheet is a fully functional Soduku game generator and is playable right on the spreadsheet. If you enable 'hints' it will show you when you enter a bad value.

The charts are there as 'boss candy' just in case you want to play a game - and look like you are doing work!

I have previously released this as freeware on www.download.com. (I am 'Lyrical Software')

Feel free to use the source code (that's why it is posted here).
